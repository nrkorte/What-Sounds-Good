# About this program

Purpose:

This program is a very dynamic triad printer. What that mean is you will give it a chord as well as a variety of other information and it will print out a fretboard containing all of the notes that will definitely sound good with it. Of course music is very creative so these notes are nothing more than a starting place, but it's a great way to get started.

How to use:

1. Install the required dependencies. You will need python 3.9.x or higher with sys, time, and re. That is all you need to get started.

2. run the "admin" file in the terminal by typing ./admin or run it manually by typing what_sounds_good.py in the terminal. It will print out a variety of prompts, just follow them closely and input the information about your guitar. My code supports guitars with up to 12 strings and up to 42 frets, though the output may look buggy for frets higher than 22.

3. There is a help menu in this program that allows the user to get help on topics they might not know about. If you are ever confused about what a prompt is asking, just type 'help' and the help menu will come up. This is also the place for finding information about how to report bugs and ask questions as well as create cuztom tunings!

4. Enjoy! This program's output is easy to read and is cool in theory. It supports lots of tunings and even allows for custom tuning if there isn't one that my program already knows of. I was going to also add custom chords but I did not get around to that.
